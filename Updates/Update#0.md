##  The Explorer Update

### What does this update contain?

This update contains everything you see right now, it is the beginning of the Bement app! As for future reference, this update log will only feed new information after a major change (in feature or design). The initial idea of the Bement app was very simple, why don’t Bement have an app? An idea needs to start simple (or small), like a seed. As time goes, you got to water it extremely well so that it won’t dry up. If you keep going a bit later, well, you got the result. 

## What again?

Sorry, let's cut to the chase. Below is a list of all the features (important ones)!

## Features
- Meal schedules
- The Look Ahead
- Calendar subscriptions
- Social media feeds
- Library web access
- Library student resources
- Identify (beta)
- Dark mode
- Inquiry (for school visitors)
- Quick contact (for someone in need) (not going to say who)
- Announcement board
- Current weather (Bement)

### Questions and Answers

Why does the interface look like it was designed by a 14 year old?

> That is because it was, but worry not, it will (probably) look better in the future.

Sometimes the app doesn't work the way I want it to, why?

> This is a very new app and it still need time for me to fix all of its problems.

I absolutely love it, but I do I tell everyone that?

> Go to the Bement app on the App Store, then click review!

## Selected Poem

> Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
> And sorry I could not travel both
> And be one traveler, long I stood
> And looked down one as far as I could
> To where it bent in the undergrowth;

> Then took the other, as just as fair,
> And having perhaps the better claim,
> Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
> Though as for that the passing there
> Had worn them really about the same,

> And both that morning equally lay
> In leaves no step had trodden black.
> Oh, I kept the first for another day!
> Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
> I doubted if I should ever come back.

> I shall be telling this with a sigh
> Somewhere ages and ages hence:
> Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
> I took the one less traveled by,\n
> And that has made all the difference.

### For future developers and maintainers (issue 1)

Hi! My name is Nico (or Runkai if you prefer). Since I am just a student, and I won't be here forever, and I need someone to look after this app. If your think you are qualified, or can withstand a challenge, then there is nothing that can stop you.
If you are here because you have no idea what is going on, my documentations are confusing (I understand), or just have no idea where to start. Visit [here](https://github.com/1105420698) and send me an email for some more technical support. The repository for the project should not be private by the time you are dealing with this. If you need any help with `git`, feel free looking for help on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com). If you did not find the official Bement app documentation yet, here is the [link](https://bement.runkaizhang.xyz/).

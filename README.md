## What is it?
It is an app that helps parents at Bement to get access to news and information quicker and easier. 

## Why would I even use this app?
Of course, as a parent at Bement, you might think that the website works just fine, but the app has its advantages: Fast and user-friendly interface, no more extra seconds to type in the URL to the website, quick access to calendars right on your phone! Last but not least, it is entirely free (and that is a great price)!
